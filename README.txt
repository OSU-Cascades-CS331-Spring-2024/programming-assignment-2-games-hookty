1. Simulate four games between yourself and the minimax player on a 4x4 board, with the depth parameter set to 5, 3, 2, and 1, respectively.

 a. What were the results of each game?
    I was able to consitently win, or draw the game. I tried going both first and second, and if I went first it wa s tie. I think this board is too small.

 b. Did the minimax player’s moves change when the depth was limited to smaller
 and smaller values?
    Not hugely, as I believe foresight is not critical when the game only last for a few moves.

 c. What was the average time per move for each of the games? Comment on why there is or is not a difference.
    Time taken was about 0.02 seconds average at depth 5, and all the way down to 0.0001 for depth 1. Minimax is exponetially timed.

2. Simulate two games between yourself and the minimax player on an 8x8 board, with the depth parameter set to 5 and 2.

 a. What were the results of each game?
    It beats me every time. I am not greate at this game.

 b. Did the minimax player’s moves change when the depth changed?
    Yes, there are enough options that sometimes a good move can be found a few moves down.

 c. What was the average time per move for each of the games? Comment on why there is or is not a difference.
    At depth 5, avaerage time was 0.5 seconds when I limited it, but quickly climbed to 2+ seconds by move 4.
